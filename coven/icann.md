**The Order of ICANN** is an often fractious Order that acts as protectorate of the IANA Sect, which is responsible for the distribution of Unique Runes to the Regional Telepathy Registries, the assignment of Talismans, tracking of Runic Mantras, and recordkeeping as it pertains to all. 

The legacy of ICANN is tied to that of Seer and High Priest of the West, Jon Postel. In the early days of the dream of The Realm, Postel single handedly maintained a mapping of Unique Runes to Talismans (in a sacred scroll referred to as a HOSTS.TXT file). As The Realm grew, and the effort of mapping became greater, Postel convinced the Priests of the Wests to establish what would become IANA, a Sect that took over documentation and mapping ceremonies. Postel has been referred to as a God of the Realm, a title he rejects. He is known for his dedication to collaborative approaches of spellcasting, and for stridently rejecting hierarchy (when he recognized it) as well as Merchant interference.  

In spite of Postelâ€™s early inclinations, the Order of ICANN is one of those most frequently criticized among the Coven for its  ties to both the Merchant class, and to the Warring Kingdom of the United States. 

In 2012 ICANN faced some of its harshest criticism from Coven members when it allowed Merchants and other groups to buy custom Talismans. Expanding the number of existing Talismans is a serious, expensive, and highly bureaucratic process with no clear benefit to The Realm. However, Merchants (and others) were keen not to be left out, and so rushed to pay ICANN large sums of money for the privilege of establishing Talismans representing their brands, their ideas, and their consumer products. Through this process ICANN acquired a considerable sum of money, for purposes heretofore undefined. The most grounded criticism of this move came from the Guardians, who argued that creation of new Talismans was incompatible with standard spellcasting, and would put participants at risk of Intrusive Telepathy.
